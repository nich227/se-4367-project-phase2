# SE 4367 Course Project (Phase 2)

## Description:
Augment the coverage collection tool implemented in Phase-1 to trace more
information about program internal states, e.g., tracing accessible field/variable values
for the beginning of each method execution. Then, infer the possible single-variable
invariants based on the Daikon technique.

Note: To run, execute in the root directory of the project under test:

```
$ mvn test
```
